# Chinook Database Analysis

## Overview
This repository features SQL queries and analysis conducted on the Chinook database, a fictional digital media store database. The project aims to explore the dataset and extract insights through SQL queries and data analysis techniques.

## Dataset
The Chinook database comprises multiple tables representing various aspects of the digital media store, including customers, invoices, tracks, albums, and genres. The dataset offers a rich source of information for analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and track popularity.

## Key Questions Explored

- What is the analysis of sales by country, providing insights into total customers, sales value, average sales, and order value per country?
- What percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs. whole albums?

## Query Writing Strategies
- Iterative query writing: Queries were developed in stages, with frequent testing and validation to ensure accuracy.
- Debugging techniques: Smaller components of queries were isolated and tested individually to identify and resolve errors.
- Data validation: Separate queries were used to validate underlying data and calculations, ensuring the integrity and reliability of analysis results.
